This program was just a side project I did to refresh my python skills for my internship of Summer 2025.
THe program starts in main.py where the user inputs how many floors they want the Hotel to be and how many elevators
they want the hotel to have. It will then run through the simulation and display the outcome as well as how many runs it took.
