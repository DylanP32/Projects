This is a Neural Net that predicts what number a certain image is from the MNIST handwritten number data set.
the input layer size is 784 neurons (28x28 pixels), the hidden layer size is 256 neurons, and the output is 10 (for numbers 0-9)

I tend to get 95%-98% accuracy with this layer set up.

I chose to use CuPy specifically because it offers GPU acceleration
