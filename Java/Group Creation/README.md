Group Creator as of the end of 2024 is the most complicated programming assignment I have ever done. We were tasked with taking a CSV file of a grid of 20 students. The grid was filled with ratings the students gave each other for how likely they were to work in a group with each person. They would only rate 8 people -3 through 5 leaving the 12 remaining students with a 0 meaning they wouldn't mind working in a group with them. We were allowed to use any resorces necessary including AI, which I pushed myself not to use for my entire assignment. The only parts that are AI generated are the actual combination generator. The rest is a culmination of my own progamming and a few things I found on Stack Overflow.
