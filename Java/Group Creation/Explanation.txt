************ Group Creator ************

Group Creator takes a CSV file of an even number of students and their ratings for each other
and converts it into functional groups. Groups are scored based off of how each person thinks of the 
other people int their group added together. Then those group scores are added up for the entire 
"combination" and compared across all combinations.

Requirements for the CSV file:
- must have a number of students that can be split evenly i.e. not a prime number.
- row 1 and column 1 must include the names of each student.
- the rest must include the ratings given to one another.

When running the program:
- add the csv file into the same directory as the GroupCreator.java file.
- go to the top of the java file and type in the name of the csv file. (In this example my CSV file is "compatibility_withnames.csv" provided to me by my professor)
- run the program and type in an integer that the total amount of people. 
- then type in a number of groups that is not 1, half of, or equal to the total amount of people. (The total number of people must be divisible by the amount of groups)
- sit back for a few milliseconds (give or take) for the groups to be made.
