# Projects
This Repository is to display some of my major assignments.

Disclaimer:
Most school assignments include constants and a general "skeleton" of the program provided by the professor.
i.e. the "Room Adventure" game loop was provided to me but item mechanics, object classes, win mechanics etc. were developed by me.
