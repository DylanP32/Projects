# School Projects
This Repository is to display some of my minor assignments that I didn't see fit to have their own repo

Disclaimer:
Some school assignments include constants and a general "skeleton" of the program provided by the professor.
i.e. the "Room Adventure" game loop was provided to me but item mechanics, object classes, win mechanics etc. were developed by myself.
Most of the data structures algorithms were done by myself with guidance from professors expllaining the algorithms in class
