# Projects
This Repository is to display some of my major assignments as well as personal projects.

Disclaimer:
Most school assignments include constants and a general skeleton of the program provided by the professor.
i.e. the "Room Adventure" game loop was provided to me but item mechanics, win conditions, etc. were developed by me.
