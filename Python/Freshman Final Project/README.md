This project was developed by two classmates and I as our final project that we had to present. Our objective was to create a program from ground up that used Python tkinter-GUI and GPIO inputs. My group attempted to make an app that would track your bench workout and give you back statistics on how the lift went and how you could improve in the future. My personal contribution was all of the user interface aspects.
